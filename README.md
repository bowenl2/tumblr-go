tumblr-go
=========

Tumblr client for the Go programming language

## TODO
* `/posts/*`, `/user/*` - I don't have a need for these but adding them is straightforward.
* OpenID - Only strictly required for the above.
* Use this instead of my butt-ugly query string construction: github.com/google/go-querystring/query
